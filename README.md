# Build a REST API with Django

The aim of this article is to help you learn awesome stuff while creating new things. We'll be creating a bucket list API. If you haven't heard about the term bucket list, it is a list of all the goals you want to achieve, dreams you want to fulfill and life experiences you desire to experience before you die (or hit the bucket). This API should therefore help us to create and manage our bucketlists.
